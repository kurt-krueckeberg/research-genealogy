There are several Find-A-grave memorials that have either a short write up or a obituary. These explain that some biblheimers moved from Pennsylvannai to Medina county,
Ohio and later to Adams county, Indiana.

Julia nee Bevelheimer Krick (1832-1906), the first children I know of David Daniel Bevelheimer/Bibelheimer, was born in PA. The next two children, Mary and Daniel,m
were also born in PA. The next XX chilren were born in Ohio, apparently in Median county, Ohio.

- The find-a-grave memorial for David Daniel bevelheimer's wife Mary states she died in 1859, I believe, but it isn't until, I believe,
1879 that David Bevelheimer is living with his youngest daugher Isabelle, but the census for that year 
doesn't have "widowed" column. 

- In one census, it states that David's wife has "rheumatism" and that she "can't write", perhaps due to it.

- in 18880, I believe, David Daniel is age 75, a cooper by occupation, living with his wife, who is 5 years younger,
  which is the correct age difference between David and his wife, who may not be his first wife.
