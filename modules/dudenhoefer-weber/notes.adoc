The Dudenhöfer, Dönges, Schwalm and maybe other (like Webers) were on the ship Copernicus with the Jacob Peppler familz. All these individuals emigrated from Rodheim, in April 1857.
And thez all appear to have settled in Marion twp, Allen Co., Indiana.

I believe "Georg Philip Dudenhöfer, born 1817, enmigrated 1840" may be the one who settle first in New Bremen, Ohio, and then in Marion twp, Allen County.
He married in Germany "Anna Rihhl??" before coming to Ohio and later Indiana.

Obituaries are proving indispensible to getting actual narratives that include life details like place-of-origin, etc.

Georg Philip Dudenhöfer's last https://bit.ly/3RvXbFe[Will and Testament] is witnessed by:

He married in Germany "Anna Rihhl??" before coming to Ohio and later Indiana.
* James M Barrett
* Louis Scherer Senior [the last two words are unclear; maybe: Louis Sh???? Lensor [this is a guess]
* Phillip [appears ot be Philip] Doenges

I can't find Dudenhofer in the 1850 census, but maybe I can find him in a platt map in 1860. He likely didn't move, and I believe his son Louis,
who is buried in Soest cemetery, took over his farm.
