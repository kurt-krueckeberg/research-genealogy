== Family Kinship Relationships

The Baades, Hartmans, Thieles, Pipenbrink, Franke (and maybe Nieman? and which others?) arrived on the same ship, on 1 August 1845. Several of these families were all from Windheim.
The Pepplers arrived with Dudenhoefers and Doenges (I am less sure of the Doenges), but I am not sure if these Dudenhoefes settled in Allen Co IN, or of the precies relationship with 
Dudenhoefers in Allen County that I already have in my tree.

There was intermarriage between Baades, Pepplers, Weber, Dudenhoefer, etc:

*todo:*

* compile a table of the mrraiges (with names, dates, sources)
* compile a list of jpoint same-ship arrivals
* create a table correlating places of residence and who lived nearby, either siblings, parents, or future spouses.

Using a rootsMagic DB query to get these relationsip
