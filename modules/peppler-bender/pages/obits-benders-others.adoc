This index was taken from Fort Wayne and Allen County, IN Area Obituary
Index, 1841-1899, and *not taken from the microfilm copies found in the
Allen County Public Library’s Genealogy Center*. Meant to abstract
information found in the obituary, the specific newspaper title, page
number, and meaning of the date (death , obituary, probate, etc.) often
are not indicated. Reasonable efforts will be made to locate and copy
these obituaries, but the volunteers and staff of the Genealogy Center
cannot guarantee that the original obituaries will be found.
